              biomaterials that merge the functionality of living cells with
              electronic components. However, the development of such advanced
              living electronics has been challenged by the inability to
              control the geometry of electroactive biofilms relative to
              solid-state electrodes. Here, we developed a lithographic
              strategy to pattern conductive biofilms of Shewanella oneidensis
              by controlling aggregation protein CdrAB expression with a blue
              light-induced genetic circuit. This controlled deposition enabled
              S. oneidensis biofilm patterning on transparent electrode
              surfaces, and electrochemical measurements allowed us to both
              demonstrate tunable conduction dependent on pattern size and
              quantify the intrinsic conductivity of the living biofilms. The
              intrinsic biofilm conductivity measurements enabled us to
              experimentally confirm predictions based on simulations of a
              recently proposed collision-exchange electron transport
              mechanism. Overall, we developed a facile technique for
              controlling electroactive biofilm formation on electrodes, with

			Recombination can be used in the laboratory to overcome component limitations in synthetic biology by creating enzymes that exhibit distinct activities and stabilities from native proteins. To investigate how recombination affects the properties of an oxidoreductase that transfers electrons in cells, we created ferredoxin (Fd) chimeras by recombining distantly related cyanobacterial and cyanomyophage Fds (53% identity) that present similar midpoint potentials but distinct thermostabilities. Fd chimeras having a wide range of amino acid substitutions retained the ability to coordinate an iron–sulfur cluster, although their thermostabilities varied with the fraction of residues inherited from each parent. The midpoint potentials of chimeric Fds also varied. However, all of the synthetic Fds exhibited midpoint potentials outside of the parental protein range. Each of the chimeric Fds could also support electron transfer between Fd-NADP reductase and sulfite reductase in Escherichia coli, although the chimeric Fds varied in the expression required for similar levels of cellular electron transfer. These results show how Fds can be diversified through recombination and reveal differences in the inheritance of thermostability and electrochemical properties. Furthermore, they illustrate how electron transfer efficiencies of chimeric Fds can be rapidly evaluated using a synthetic metabolic pathway.

			Monitoring microbial reactions in highly opaque or autofluorescent environments like soils, seawater, and wastewater remains challenging. To develop a simple approach for observing post-translational reactions within microbes situated in environmental matrices, we designed a methyl halide transferase (MHT) fragment complementation assay that reports by synthesizing an indicator gas. We show that backbone fission within regions of high sequence variability in the Rossmann domain yields split MHT (sMHT) AND gates whose fragments cooperatively associate to synthesize CH3Br. Additionally, we identify a sMHT whose fragments require fusion to pairs of interacting partner proteins for maximal activity. We also show that sMHT fragments fused to FKBP12 and the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of mTOR display significantly enhanced CH3Br production in the presence of rapamycin. This gas production is reversed in the presence of the competitive inhibitor of FKBP12/FKPB dimerization, indicating that sMHT is a reversible reporter of post-translational reactions. This sMHT represents the first genetic AND gate that reports on protein–protein interactions via an indicator gas. Because indicator gases can be measured in the headspaces of complex environmental samples, this assay should be useful for monitoring the dynamics of diverse molecular interactions within microbes situated in hard-to-image marine and terrestrial matrices.

            Adenylate kinase (AK) orthologs with a range of thermostabilities were subjected to random circular permutation, and deep mutational scanning was used to evaluate where new protein termini were nondisruptive to activity. The fraction of circularly permuted variants that retained function in each library correlated with AK thermostability. In addition, analysis of the positional tolerance to new termini, which increase local conformational flexibility, showed that bonds were either functionally sensitive to cleavage across all homologs, differentially sensitive, or uniformly tolerant. The mobile AMP-binding domain, which displays the highest calculated contact energies, presented the greatest tolerance to new termini across all AKs. In contrast, retention of function in the lid and core domains was more dependent upon AK melting temperature. These results show that family permutation profiling identifies primary structure that has been selected by evolution for dynamics that are critical to activity within an enzyme family. These findings also illustrate how deep mutational scanning can be applied to protein homologs in parallel to differentiate how topology, stability, and local energetics govern mutational tolerance.},

To overcome this component limitation, we randomly inserted the ligand binding domain (LBD) from the estrogen receptor (ER) into a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin (Fd) and used a bacterial selection to identify protein variants that support electron transfer in cells. Mapping LBD insertion sites onto structure revealed that Fd tolerates domain insertion adjacent to or within the tetracysteine motif that coordinates the 2Fe-2S metallocluster. With both protein designs, cellular electron transfer (ET) was enhanced by the ER antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen, albeit to different extents. One variant arising from ER-LBD insertion within the tetracysteine motif acquired an oxygen-tolerant 2Fe-2S cluster, suggesting that ET is regulated through post-translational ligand binding. These metalloprotein switches are expected to be useful for achieving fast regulation of ET in engineered metabolic pathways and between electroactive bacteria and conductive materials.},

To enable dynamic, protein-level control over energy flow in metabolic systems for synthetic biology and bioelectronics, we created ferredoxin logic gates that utilize transcriptional and post-translational inputs to control energy flow through a synthetic electron transfer pathway that is required for bacterial growth. These logic gates were created by subjecting a thermostable, plant-type ferredoxin to backbone fission and fusing the resulting fragments to a pair of proteins that self-associate, a pair of proteins whose association is stabilized by a small molecule, and to the termini of a ligand-binding domain. We show that the latter domain insertion design strategy yields an allosteric ferredoxin switch that acquires an oxygen-tolerant [2Fe–2S] cluster and can use different chemicals, including a therapeutic drug and an environmental pollutant, to control the production of a reduced metabolite in Escherichia coli and cell lysates.}

We describe a new method, termed circular permutation profiling with DNA sequencing (CPP-seq), which combines a one-step transposon mutagenesis protocol for creating libraries with a functional selection, deep sequencing and computational analysis to obtain unbiased insight into a protein’s tolerance to circular permutation. Application of this method to an adenylate kinase revealed that CPP-seq creates two types of vectors encoding each circularly permuted gene, which differ in their ability to express proteins. Functional selection of this library revealed that >65% of the sampled vectors that express proteins are enriched relative to those that cannot translate proteins. Mapping enriched sequences onto structure revealed that the mobile AMP binding and rigid core domains display greater tolerance to backbone fragmentation than the mobile lid domain, illustrating how CPP-seq can be used to relate a protein's biophysical characteristics to the retention of activity upon permutation.},

While considerable biochemical information about individual Fd protein electron carriers and their reactions has been acquired, we cannot yet anticipate the proportion of electrons shuttled between different Fd-partner proteins within cells using biochemical parameters that govern electron flow, such as holo-Fd concentration, midpoint potential (driving force), molecular interactions (affinity and kinetics), conformational changes (allostery), and off-pathway electron leakage (chemical oxidation). Herein, we describe functional and structural gaps in our Fd knowledge within the context of a sequence similarity network and phylogenetic tree, and we propose a strategy for improving our understanding of Fd sequence–function relationships. We suggest comparing the functions of divergent Fds within cells whose growth, or other measurable output, requires electron transfer between defined electron donor and acceptor proteins. By comparing Fd-mediated electron transfer with biochemical parameters that govern electron flow, we posit that models that anticipate energy flow across Fd interactomes can be built. This approach is expected to transform our ability to anticipate Fd control over electron flow in cellular settings, an obstacle to the construction of synthetic electron transfer pathways and rational optimization of existing energy-conserving pathways.}

	abstract = {Proteins can be engineered for synthetic biology through circular permutation, a sequence rearrangement in which native protein termini become linked and new termini are created elsewhere through backbone fission. However, it remains challenging to anticipate a protein’s functional tolerance to circular permutation. Here, we describe new transposons for creating libraries of randomly circularly permuted proteins that minimize peptide additions at their termini, and we use transposase mutagenesis to study the tolerance of a thermophilic adenylate kinase (AK) to circular permutation. We find that libraries expressing permuted AKs with either short or long peptides amended to their N-terminus yield distinct sets of active variants and present evidence that this trend arises because permuted protein expression varies across libraries. Mapping all sites that tolerate backbone cleavage onto AK structure reveals that the largest contiguous regions of sequence that lack cleavage sites are proximal to the phosphotransfer site. A comparison of our results with a range of structure-derived parameters further showed that retention of function correlates to the strongest extent with the distance to the phosphotransfer site, amino acid variability in an AK family sequence alignment, and residue-level deviations in superimposed AK structures. Our work illustrates how permuted protein libraries can be created with minimal peptide additions using transposase mutagenesis, and it reveals a challenge of maintaining consistent expression across permuted variants in a library that minimizes peptide additions. Furthermore, these findings provide a basis for interpreting responses of thermophilic phosphotransferases to circular permutation by calibrating how different structure-derived parameters relate to retention of function in a cellular selection.},
