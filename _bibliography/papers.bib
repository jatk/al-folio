	abstract = {Electroactive bacterial biofilms can function as living biomaterials that merge the functionality of living cells with electronic components. However, the development of such advanced living electronics has been challenged by the inability to control the geometry of electroactive biofilms relative to solid-state electrodes. Here, we developed a lithographic strategy to pattern conductive biofilms of Shewanella oneidensis by controlling aggregation protein CdrAB expression with a blue light-induced genetic circuit. This controlled deposition enabled S. oneidensis biofilm patterning on transparent electrode surfaces, and electrochemical measurements allowed us to both demonstrate tunable conduction dependent on pattern size and quantify the intrinsic conductivity of the living biofilms. The intrinsic biofilm conductivity measurements enabled us to experimentally confirm predictions based on simulations of a recently proposed collision-exchange electron transport mechanism. Overall, we developed a facile technique for controlling electroactive biofilm formation on electrodes, with implications for both studying and harnessing bioelectronics.},

	abstract = {The multiheme cytochrome MtrA enables microbial respiration by transferring electrons across the outer membrane to extracellular electron acceptors. While structural studies have identified residues that mediate the binding of MtrA to hemes and to other cytochromes that facilitate extracellular electron transfer (EET), the relative importance of these interactions for EET is not known. To better understand EET, we evaluated how insertion of an octapeptide across all MtrA backbone locations affects Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 respiration on Fe(III). The EET efficiency was found to be inversely correlated with the proximity of the insertion to the heme prosthetic groups. Mutants with decreased EET efficiencies also arose from insertions in a subset of the regions that make residue-residue contacts with the porin MtrB, while all sites contacting the extracellular cytochrome MtrC presented high peptide insertion tolerance. MtrA variants having peptide insertions within the CXXCH motifs that coordinate heme cofactors retained some ability to support respiration on Fe(III), although these variants presented significantly decreased EET efficiencies. Furthermore, the fitness of cells expressing different MtrA variants under Fe(III) respiration conditions correlated with anode reduction. The peptide insertion profile, which represents the first comprehensive sequence-structure-function map for a multiheme cytochrome, implicates MtrA as a strategic protein engineering target for the regulation of EET.},

These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic-abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics is reported. The coating is based on a blend of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) crosslinked with poly(2-hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current-producing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, this material produces a 178-fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin-film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. The chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings are characterized and the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor based microbial sensors are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.},

Here, results of a bioinformatics analysis using a sequence similarity network revealed that phage Fds are most closely related to cyanobacterial Fds that transfer electrons from photosystems to oxidoreductases involved in nutrient assimilation. Structural analysis of myovirus P-SSM2 Fd (pssm2-Fd), which infects the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus, revealed high levels of similarity to cyanobacterial Fds (root mean square deviations of \${\textbackslash}leq\$0.5 Å). Additionally, pssm2-Fd exhibited a low midpoint reduction potential (-336 mV versus a standard hydrogen electrode), similar to other photosynthetic Fds, although it had lower thermostability (Tm = 28 °C) than did many other Fds. When expressed in an Escherichia coli strain deficient in sulfite assimilation, pssm2-Fd complemented bacterial growth when coexpressed with a P. marinus sulfite reductase, revealing that pssm2-Fd can transfer electrons to a host protein involved in nutrient assimilation. The high levels of structural similarity with cyanobacterial Fds and reactivity with a host sulfite reductase suggest that phage Fds evolved to transfer electrons to cyanobacterially encoded oxidoreductases.},

	abstract = {Monitoring microbial reactions in highly opaque or autofluorescent environments like soils, seawater, and wastewater remains challenging. To develop a simple approach for observing post-translational reactions within microbes situated in environmental matrices, we designed a methyl halide transferase (MHT) fragment complementation assay that reports by synthesizing an indicator gas. We show that backbone fission within regions of high sequence variability in the Rossmann domain yields split MHT (sMHT) AND gates whose fragments cooperatively associate to synthesize CH3Br. Additionally, we identify a sMHT whose fragments require fusion to pairs of interacting partner proteins for maximal activity. We also show that sMHT fragments fused to FKBP12 and the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of mTOR display significantly enhanced CH3Br production in the presence of rapamycin. This gas production is reversed in the presence of the competitive inhibitor of FKBP12/FKPB dimerization, indicating that sMHT is a reversible reporter of post-translational reactions. This sMHT represents the first genetic AND gate that reports on protein-protein interactions via an indicator gas. Because indicator gases can be measured in the headspaces of complex environmental samples, this assay should be useful for monitoring the dynamics of diverse molecular interactions within microbes situated in hard-to-image marine and terrestrial matrices.},

	abstract = {Abstract One challenge with controlling electron flow in cells is the lack of biomolecules that directly couple environmental sensing to electron transfer efficiency. To overcome this component limitation, we randomly inserted the ligand binding domain (LBD) from the estrogen receptor (ER) into a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin (Fd) and used a bacterial selection to identify protein variants that support electron transfer in cells. Mapping LBD insertion sites onto structure revealed that Fd tolerates domain insertion adjacent to or within the tetracysteine motif that coordinates the 2Fe-2S metallocluster. With both protein designs, cellular electron transfer (ET) was enhanced by the ER antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen, albeit to different extents. One variant arising from ER-LBD insertion within the tetracysteine motif acquired an oxygen-tolerant 2Fe-2S cluster, suggesting that ET is regulated through post-translational ligand binding. These metalloprotein switches are expected to be useful for achieving fast regulation of ET in engineered metabolic pathways and between electroactive bacteria and conductive materials.},

To enable dynamic, protein-level control over energy flow in metabolic systems for synthetic biology and bioelectronics, we created ferredoxin logic gates that utilize transcriptional and post-translational inputs to control energy flow through a synthetic electron transfer pathway that is required for bacterial growth. These logic gates were created by subjecting a thermostable, plant-type ferredoxin to backbone fission and fusing the resulting fragments to a pair of proteins that self-associate, a pair of proteins whose association is stabilized by a small molecule, and to the termini of a ligand-binding domain. We show that the latter domain insertion design strategy yields an allosteric ferredoxin switch that acquires an oxygen-tolerant [2Fe-2S] cluster and can use different chemicals, including a therapeutic drug and an environmental pollutant, to control the production of a reduced metabolite in Escherichia coli and cell lysates.},

The fraction of circularly permuted variants that retained function in each library correlated with AK thermostability. In addition, analysis of the positional tolerance to new termini, which increase local conformational flexibility, showed that bonds were either functionally sensitive to cleavage across all homologs, differentially sensitive, or uniformly tolerant. The mobile AMP-binding domain, which displays the highest calculated contact energies, presented the greatest tolerance to new termini across all AKs. In contrast, retention of function in the lid and core domains was more dependent upon AK melting temperature. These results show that family permutation profiling identifies primary structure that has been selected by evolution for dynamics that are critical to activity within an enzyme family. These findings also illustrate how deep mutational scanning can be applied to protein homologs in parallel to differentiate how topology, stability, and local energetics govern mutational tolerance.},

We describe a new method, termed circular permutation profiling with DNA sequencing (CPP-seq), which combines a one-step transposon mutagenesis protocol for creating libraries with a functional selection, deep sequencing and computational analysis to obtain unbiased insight into a protein's tolerance to circular permutation. Application of this method to an adenylate kinase revealed that CPP-seq creates two types of vectors encoding each circularly permuted gene, which differ in their ability to express proteins. Functional selection of this library revealed that {\textgreater}65\% of the sampled vectors that express proteins are enriched relative to those that cannot translate proteins. Mapping enriched sequences onto structure revealed that the mobile AMP binding and rigid core domains display greater tolerance to backbone fragmentation than the mobile lid domain, illustrating how CPP-seq can be used to relate a protein's biophysical characteristics to the retention of activity upon permutation.},

Herein, we describe functional and structural gaps in our Fd knowledge within the context of a sequence similarity network and phylogenetic tree, and we propose a strategy for improving our understanding of Fd sequence-function relationships. We suggest comparing the functions of divergent Fds within cells whose growth, or other measurable output, requires electron transfer between defined electron donor and acceptor proteins. By comparing Fd-mediated electron transfer with biochemical parameters that govern electron flow, we posit that models that anticipate energy flow across Fd interactomes can be built.

However, it remains challenging to anticipate a protein's functional tolerance to circular permutation. Here, we describe new transposons for creating libraries of randomly circularly permuted proteins that minimize peptide additions at their termini, and we use transposase mutagenesis to study the tolerance of a thermophilic adenylate kinase (AK) to circular permutation. We find that libraries expressing permuted AKs with either short or long peptides amended to their N-terminus yield distinct sets of active variants and present evidence that this trend arises because permuted protein expression varies across libraries. Mapping all sites that tolerate backbone cleavage onto AK structure reveals that the largest contiguous regions of sequence that lack cleavage sites are proximal to the phosphotransfer site. A comparison of our results with a range of structure-derived parameters further showed that retention of function correlates to the strongest extent with the distance to the phosphotransfer site, amino acid variability in an AK family sequence alignment, and residue-level deviations in superimposed AK structures. Our work illustrates how permuted protein libraries can be created with minimal peptide additions using transposase mutagenesis, and it reveals a challenge of maintaining consistent expression across permuted variants in a library that minimizes peptide additions. Furthermore, these findings provide a basis for interpreting responses of thermophilic phosphotransferases to circular permutation by calibrating how different structure-derived parameters relate to retention of function in a cellular selection.},

Here, we demonstrate that the strength of Ubx materials is due to intermolecular dityrosine bonds. Ubx materials auto-fluoresce blue, a characteristic of dityrosine, and bind dityrosine-specific antibodies. Monitoring the fluorescence of reduced Ubx fibers upon oxygen exposure reveals biphasic bond formation kinetics. Two dityrosine bonds in Ubx were identified by site-directed mutagenesis followed by measurements of fiber fluorescent intensity. One bond is located between the N-terminus and the homeodomain (Y4/Y296 or Y12/Y293), and another bond is formed by Y167 and Y240. Fiber fluorescence closely correlates with fiber strength, demonstrating that these bonds are intermolecular. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of specific residues that participate in dityrosine bonds in protein-based materials. The percentage of Ubx molecules harboring both bonds can be decreased or increased by mutagenesis, providing an additional mechanism to control the mechanical properties of Ubx materials. Duplication of tyrosine-containing motifs in Ubx increases dityrosine content in Ubx fibers, suggesting these motifs could be inserted in other self-assembling proteins to strengthen the corresponding materials.},
